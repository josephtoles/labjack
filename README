| 1  INSTALL DRIVERS   |
+——————————————————————+
This section explains how to install the drivers necessary to run this program.

Plug the LabJack into the computer using the USB cable.

Go to http://labjack.com/support/u3 and click “Linux Package”. This will download a compressed folder called “exodriver-master”. Extract it. Open the extracted folder. There are instructions in the “README” and “INSTALL.Linux” files but you don’t need them. Follow these instructions to install the drivers.

Once you have installed the drivers, go into exodriver-master’s “examples/u3” folder. Enter the “make” command. Run “u3EFunctions”. If it works you’re ready to go.

This section lists useful information.

Information on temperature coefficients can be foudn at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_coefficient
	R(T)  = R(T_0)(1+alpha(T_1-T_0))
	T_0   = 100 ohms @ 0°C
	alpha = 0.00385 °C^-1
The LabJack does not actually read voltages at 0.000V. It only goes down to 0.003V. So I will use and idealized range of

The pressure sensor we use is of the following make
	SSI Technologies Inc
	P51-200-A-E-I36-5V-000-000

CALIBRATION NOTES

0.000V at 18 ohms
and
2.400V at 118 ohms

This means that Voltage = 0.005V + 2.400V(resistance-18)/100

But the actual test resistances I'm using are 116.0 (varies between 115.9 and 116.2 ohms) and 18.0 (varies between 17.8 and 18.3) ohms
so the voltages I should look for are

0.005V at 18.0 ohms
and
2.357V at 116.0 ohms

0.072V at 20.8 ohm
1.740 V at 90.3 ohm

voltage = 2.400*(resistance-18)/100+.005

8  ohm resistor is actually  7.4 ohms
18 ohm resistor is actually 20.8 ohms
90 ohm resistor is actually 90.3 ohms




Channel 0:
	0.092V at 20.8ohm
	1.796V at 90.3ohm
	v0 = 0.092
	r0 = 20.8
	v1 = 1.796
	r1 = 90.3
