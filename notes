Calibrate pressure sensor with a voltage generator

Modify program to record raw voltage, resistance


0.4/0.5 (PSI) should be zero
    0.015V read by box
    1.000V (pressure sensor output)
15.0/15.1 (PSI) is 1 atm
    0.192V
When exactly 2V is put into the box, 50.3PSI comes out of the terminal. This is probably because the box needs some calibration.


Start a measurement before you leave today.
